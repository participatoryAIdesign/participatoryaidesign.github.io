              We invite researchers, practitioners, and professionals working at the intersection of AI, public policy, and civic engagement 
              to join our upcoming hybrid workshop on <strong>Emerging Practices in Participatory AI Design in Public Sector Innovation</strong>. 
              This workshop will explore critical themes and methods that facilitate public participation and community engagement --- in the scoping, 
              design, and implementation of public sector algorithms that are more inclusive and responsive to public needs. Submissions should be emailed 
              to <a href="mailto:participatoryaidesign@gmail.com">participatoryaidesign@gmail.com.</a></p> 
              <p class = "text">
                We will explore the following themes at this workshop:

            <h3>1. Evaluating Emerging Participatory Methods</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <p class="text"> We will assess various participatory design methods currently in use within public sector AI projects, 
                  highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in engaging communities. Participants will share insights on how these methods 
                  can be adapted or expanded to ensure more meaningful public involvement.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Assessing Key Elements that Enhance Participation and Documentable Outcomes.</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <p class="text"> This theme focuses on identifying the essential elements that foster effective public participation in the public sector, 
                  as well as exploring documentable and/or measurable outcomes that can demonstrate the success of engagement efforts. We will discuss 
                  strategies for building trust, ensuring transparency, and capturing diverse perspectives necessary for equitable AI systems.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Embedding Participation Requirements in AI Procurement Contracts.</h3>
            <hr>
            <ul>
                <p class="text"> As many cities acquire AI from private vendors, this theme will explore how public agencies can include participation 
                  requirements in procurement contracts. We will discuss how embedding these requirements can ensure accountability and alignment with public 
                  interests.

              Participants are encouraged to submit a 2-3 page paper, detailing either research related to one of the workshopâ€™s core themes or providing 
              a motivation statement that explains their reasons for attending the workshop. We are flexible about length and format to accommodate the norms 
              of practitioners not from academia. These themes might include topics such as participatory methodologies, public engagement, or ethical AI in government settings.  
            </p>
            <p class="text" style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;">
              Submissions will be reviewed by two organizers, with an emphasis on both the quality of the work and ensuring a diverse, interdisciplinary group of participants. This is an opportunity to contribute to and help shape the evolving landscape of AI in public sector innovation.

            </p>
            <p class="text" style="margin-bottom:1cm;">
               Submissions should be emailed to <a href="mailto:participatoryaidesign@gmail.com">participatoryaidesign@gmail.com</a>. We look forward to your participation!
