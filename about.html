              <li><strong>Devansh Saxena</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Information School and the School of Computer, Data, and Information Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research focuses on participatory design and responsible AI innovation in the public sector and designing systems that center well-being, elevate human expertise, and collective decision-making. Before joining UW-Madison, he was a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute where his research focused on developing new methods and tools that support AI innovation at the earliest stages of ideation, problem formulation, and project selection.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Erina Moon</strong> is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. In her research, she studies the use of and design of public sector data and AI systems. Through collaborative engagements with local governments and impacted stakeholders within homelessness and housing services, she uses mixed methods to examine how data and computational systems can augment or hinder decision-making, resource allocation, and measurement.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Anna Kawakami</strong> is a PhD candidate in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Her research explores ways to design towards more positive futures for AI in workplace settings, with a particular focus on the public sector. To do this, she partners with public sector agencies to understand their current practices and challenges around AI design, adoption, and governance. Through these partnerships, she also explores ways to address these challenges by collaboratively designing new processes and tools that support stakeholders in shaping decision points across the AI pipeline that would otherwise remain inaccessible and opaque to them. </li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Corey Jackson</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Information School at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. His research bridges human-centered computing, computer-supported cooperative work, and design epistemologies from fields such as organization studies, psychology, and education. His work employs qualitative and quantitative methodologies and is informed by a socio-technical perspective and theories. His research contributes to the design of open collaboration platforms and is directed by two complementary approaches: (1) documenting human experiences online and (2) implementing and evaluating system affordances.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Min Kyung Lee</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Lee has conducted some of the first studies that empirically examine the social implications of algorithms; emerging roles in management and governance in society, looking at the impacts of algorithmic management on workers as well as public perceptions of algorithmic fairness. She has proposed a participatory framework that empowers community members to design matching algorithms for their own communities.</li>            
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Sarah Fox</strong> is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human Computer Interaction Institute, where she directs the Tech Solidarity Lab. Her work examines the impacts of AI and automation on essential work sectors, with a focus on developing systems that center workers’ needs and expertise. Her work has earned awards in leading computing venues including ACM CSCW, CHI, and DIS, and has been featured in Design Issues, the Journal of Peer Production, and New Media and Society. She holds a Ph.D. in Human Centered Design \& Engineering from the University of Washington. Her research has been covered by news outlets such as Politico and the Associated Press and is supported by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Transportation, the Russell Sage Foundation, among others.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Shion Guha</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Information and cross-appointed to the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. His research interests include human-computer interaction, data science, and public policy. He’s been involved in developing the field of Human-Centred Data Science. This intersectional research area combines technical methodologies with interpretive inquiry to address biases and structural inequalities in socio-technical systems. He is the author of Human-Centered Data Science: An Introduction, an Amazon Best Selling textbook published by MIT Press in 2022.  Shion wants to understand how algorithmic decision-making processes are designed, implemented and evaluated in public services. In doing so, he often works with marginalized and vulnerable populations, such as communities impacted by child welfare, homelessness, and public health systems.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Sheena Erete</strong> is an Associate Professor in the College of Information at the University of Maryland, College Park, the associate director of research for the Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland (AIM), and the director of the Community Research, Equity, and Design Collective (CREED) Collective. Her research focuses on co-designing socio-cultural technologies, practices, and policies with historically marginalized populations to amplify their existing efforts in addressing social issues. Centering community knowledge and strengths, she leverages Black feminist epistemologies and transformative justice practices to address issues such as equity in AI/ML tools, community safety, education, political efficacy, and economic development.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Jean Hardy</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Media \& Information where he leads the Rural Computing Research Consortium and serves as a Research Fellow at the Quello Center. His research areas include: rural computing, science and technology studies (STS), computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), and rural studies. His research focus primarily revolves around the role of technology in rural economic and community development. Some current projects in this area focus on: the role of the high-tech economy in rural economic development; the downstream impacts of technological innovation in rural communities and people; the adoption and use of information technology in community-based agricultural organizations; and policy and design interventions for promoting digital resilience in face of changing broadband policy landscapes. He also does research on the use and design of collaborative technologies, particularly among rural LGBTQ people and in hybrid school settings. His work has been funded by the Spencer Foundation, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Merit Network. He holds a Doctorate and Master of Science in Information from the University of Michigan School of Information, and a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and Theory from the University of Washington.  </li>
