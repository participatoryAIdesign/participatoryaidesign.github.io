              <li><strong>Devansh Saxena</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Information School and the School of Computer, Data, and Information Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research focuses on participatory design and responsible AI innovation in the public sector and designing systems that center well-being, elevate human expertise, and collective decision-making. Before joining UW-Madison, he was a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute where his research focused on developing new methods and tools that support AI innovation at the earliest stages of ideation, problem formulation, and project selection.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Zoe Kahn</strong> is a PhD Candidate at the UC Berkeley School of Information. To inform the design of more responsible tech and tech policy, her research integrates the perspectives of people with lived expertise alongside people with domain expertise (e.g., data scientists, policymaker, privacy scholars). She uses qualitative methods to understand the perspectives and experiences of impacted communities, and leverages storytelling to influence the design of technical systems and the policies that surround their use. In the process, she has developed new methods for participatory AI. Zoe has conducted empirical studies in rural villages in Togo, rural ranching communities in the United States, among tech workers at large engineering organizations, and users on Twitter.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Erina Moon</strong> is a PhD student at the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. In her research, she studies the use of and design of public sector data and AI systems. Through collaborative engagements with local governments and impacted stakeholders within homelessness and housing services, she uses mixed methods to examine how data and computational systems can augment or hinder decision-making, resource allocation, and measurement.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Lauren Chambers</strong> is a PhD student at the UC Berkeley School of Information, where she studies the intersection of data, technology, and sociopolitical advocacy. Previously Lauren was the staff technologist at the ACLU of Massachusetts, where she explored government data in order to inform citizens and lawmakers about the effects of legislation and government on our civil liberties. Her current research explores the roles of 'public interest technologists' within civil society as they are shaping policy, reconfiguring service delivery, and transforming political campaigns.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Corey Jackson</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Information School at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. His research bridges human-centered computing, computer-supported cooperative work, and design epistemologies from fields such as organization studies, psychology, and education. His work employs qualitative and quantitative methodologies and is informed by a socio-technical perspective and theories. His research contributes to the design of open collaboration platforms and is directed by two complementary approaches: (1) documenting human experiences online and (2) implementing and evaluating system affordances.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Min Kyung Lee</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Lee has conducted some of the first studies that empirically examine the social implications of algorithms; emerging roles in management and governance in society, looking at the impacts of algorithmic management on workers as well as public perceptions of algorithmic fairness. She has proposed a participatory framework that empowers community members to design matching algorithms for their own communities.</li>            
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Motahhare Eslami</strong> is an Assistant Professor at the School of Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), and Institute for Software Research (ISR), at Carnegie Mellon University. She earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Motahhare’s research goal is to investigate the existing accountability challenges in algorithmic systems and to empower the users of algorithmic systems, particularly those who belong to marginalized communities or those whose decisions impact marginalized communities, make transparent, fair, and informed decisions in interaction with algorithmic systems.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Shion Guha</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Information and cross-appointed to the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. His research interests include human-computer interaction, data science, and public policy. He’s been involved in developing the field of Human-Centred Data Science. This intersectional research area combines technical methodologies with interpretive inquiry to address biases and structural inequalities in socio-technical systems. He is the author of Human-Centered Data Science: An Introduction, an Amazon Best Selling textbook published by MIT Press in 2022.  Shion wants to understand how algorithmic decision-making processes are designed, implemented and evaluated in public services. In doing so, he often works with marginalized and vulnerable populations, such as communities impacted by child welfare, homelessness, and public health systems.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Sheena Erete</strong> is an Associate Professor in the College of Information at the University of Maryland, College Park, the associate director of research for the Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland (AIM), and the director of the Community Research, Equity, and Design Collective (CREED) Collective. Her research focuses on co-designing socio-cultural technologies, practices, and policies with historically marginalized populations to amplify their existing efforts in addressing social issues. Centering community knowledge and strengths, she leverages Black feminist epistemologies and transformative justice practices to address issues such as equity in AI/ML tools, community safety, education, political efficacy, and economic development.</li>
              <hr>
              <li><strong>Lilly Irani</strong> is an Associate Professor of Communication \& Science Studies at University of California, San Diego. She also serves as faculty in the Design Lab, Institute for Practical Ethics, the program in Critical Gender Studies, and sits on the Academic Advisory Board of AI Now (NYU). She is author of Chasing Innovation: Making Entrepreneurial Citizens in Modern India (Princeton University Press, 2019) and Redacted (with Jesse Marx) (Taller California, 2021). Chasing Innovation has been awarded the 2020 International Communication Association Outstanding Book Award and the 2019 Diana Forsythe Prize for feminist anthropological research on work, science, or technology, including biomedicine. She is a co-founder of the digital worker advocacy organization Turkopticon. Her work has appeared at ACM SIGCHI, New Media \& Society, Science, Technology \& Human Values, South Atlantic Quarterly, and other venues. She sits on the Steering Committee of the San Diego Transparent and Responsible Use of Surveillance Technology Coalition and the board of United Taxi Workers San Diego. </li>
